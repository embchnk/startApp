This is site which is being opened by PHP script.</br>
The parameter "exploit" is representing document which is being</br>
rendered by file_get_contents() method.
</br>The main danger in using that method is that it</br>
is able to display documents passed as filenames but also</br>
it can display documents passed as URL.
